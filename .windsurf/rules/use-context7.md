Use context7 to get svelte, sveltekit and shadcn-svelte-next, svelte-magicui, svelte-motion docs as needed. Also if there is a technology you have to use no matter how much you think you know about it, first use context7 to get the docs, when that fails use exa search to try to get more info and finally use that.
