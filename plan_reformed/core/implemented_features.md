# Implemented Features

Based on the provided code and project structure, the following features have been successfully implemented in the Myth Buster web application:

## 2.1 Myth Verification Interface (`/app`)

Users can input a statement, submit it for analysis via the Perplexity Sonar API, and receive a verdict (True, False, Inconclusive) with a detailed explanation and citations. The interface includes elements for displaying the verdict, explanation, citations, myth origin, related myths, and reasons why the myth might be believed. It also includes basic loading states and a reset function.

## 2.2 Myth Busting Game (`/game`)

An interactive game where the AI generates statements, and the user guesses if they are true or false, indicating their confidence level. The game tracks the user's score and streak, persisting these between sessions using browser storage. After answering, the user receives immediate feedback, points, and an explanation with sources.

## 2.3 User Authentication

A complete user authentication system is implemented, allowing users to:

*   Sign up for a new account.
*   Sign in with existing credentials.
*   Sign out of their account.
*   View and update their profile details (username, email).
*   Change their password.

This system leverages SvelteKit's server-side capabilities for secure handling of credentials and sessions.

## 2.4 Community Signups (`/community`)

The community page displays the number of users who have signed up for community updates. It includes a form (in a dialog) for new users to join the waitlist, which is handled via a custom API endpoint.

## 2.5 Landing Page (`/`)

A visually engaging landing page introduces the Myth Buster app, highlighting its core purpose and features through various sections and animated elements. Key features on the landing page include:

*   **Interactive "Mini-Myth" Quick Check:**
    *   **Description:** A section on the landing page (`MiniMythCheck.svelte`) allows users to quickly test their knowledge. It fetches 5 random myth statements, along with their verdicts and explanations, from a dedicated API endpoint (`/api/minimyths`). This endpoint, in turn, instructs the Perplexity API to generate and verify these 5 myths.
    *   **Functionality:** Users can click "True" or "False" for each presented myth and receive instant feedback and a concise explanation. The component handles loading states and potential errors during the API fetch. This feature provides an immediate demonstration of the app's core myth-busting capabilities.

## 2.6 About Page (`/about`)

An informative page providing details about the project's mission, a list of its features, and information about the technology stack used.
