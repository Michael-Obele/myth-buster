# Hackathon Submission Strategy: Best Deep Research Project

This document outlines our strategy for presenting Myth Buster as a strong contender for the "Best Deep Research Project" category in the Perplexity Sonar API Hackathon.

## Understanding the Judging Criteria

Based on our research, the "Best Deep Research Project" category likely evaluates:

1. **Depth and sophistication of research capabilities**
2. **Effective leverage of Perplexity Sonar API's advanced features**
3. **User agency in guiding the research process**
4. **Technical implementation quality**
5. **UI/UX design for complex information presentation**
6. **Practical utility and potential impact**

## Demo Video Strategy (≤ 3 minutes)

### Structure:

1. **Introduction (20 seconds)**
   - Brief overview of Myth Buster's purpose
   - Highlight the problem it solves (misinformation requires deep, nuanced research)
   - Position as a "research assistant that goes beyond simple fact-checking"

2. **Core Verification Demo (30 seconds)**
   - Show the basic myth verification flow
   - Input a compelling, nuanced myth example (e.g., "Does lightning never strike the same place twice?")
   - Briefly show the verdict, explanation, and citations

3. **Deep Research Features Showcase (1 minute, 40 seconds)**
   - **Multi-Angle Investigation (40 seconds)**
     - Show selection of a research lens (e.g., Historical)
     - Demonstrate creation of a custom lens
     - Highlight the depth of information received

   - **Evidence Deconstruction (30 seconds)**
     - Click on a citation to analyze the source
     - Show selection of analysis type and custom query
     - Demonstrate critical evaluation of evidence

   - **Insight Mapping (30 seconds)**
     - Show synthesis of findings across lenses
     - Highlight themes, contradictions, and connections identified
     - Emphasize how this transforms scattered information into cohesive understanding

4. **Conclusion (30 seconds)**
   - Emphasize how Myth Buster transforms the Sonar API into a guided research tool
   - Highlight metrics (e.g., "Condenses hours of research into minutes")
   - End with a call to action for fighting misinformation through deeper understanding

### Production Tips:

- Use concise narration that emphasizes research depth
- Include on-screen captions highlighting key points
- Use visual cues (arrows, highlights) to draw attention to deep research features
- Maintain a brisk pace while still clearly demonstrating functionality
- Use a compelling example myth that showcases nuance and complexity
