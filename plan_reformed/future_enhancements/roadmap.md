# Future Enhancements Roadmap

This document outlines potential areas for future development of the Myth Buster application, building upon the currently implemented features.

## 1. Comprehensive Error Handling

Implement the detailed error handling strategy including:

*   **Custom Error Types:** Define and use specific error types (`ErrorType` enum).
*   **Centralized Error Store:** Manage application-wide error state (`errorStore`).
*   **Error Boundaries:** Use `<ErrorBoundary>` components to gracefully handle rendering errors.
*   **User-Friendly Messages:** Map error types to clear, actionable messages for the user.
*   **Integration with API Client:** Ensure all API errors are caught, classified, and dispatched to the error store.

## 2. Advanced Caching Mechanism

Enhance the existing caching with:

*   **Persistent Storage:** Utilize `localStorage` more robustly for longer-term caching.
*   **Cache Expiration:** Implement TTL (Time-To-Live) for cached entries.
*   **Cache Pruning:** Manage cache size to prevent exceeding storage limits.
*   **Offline Fallback:** Improve the experience when the user is offline, serving cached results automatically.

## 3. User Onboarding Experience

Develop a guided onboarding flow for first-time users:

*   **Welcome Screen:** Introduce the app's purpose.
*   **Feature Highlights:** Briefly explain key features (Verification, Game, etc.).
*   **Sample Myths:** Provide interactive examples to get users started.
*   **Contextual Tooltips:** Offer hints on key UI elements.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Allow users to track their progress through the onboarding.

## 4. Microinteractions and Animation Polish

Refine the application's animations and add subtle microinteractions:

*   **Purposeful Animations:** Ensure all animations serve a clear UX purpose.
*   **Smooth Transitions:** Implement smooth transitions between different views and states (e.g., input to results, tab switches).
*   **Loading State Animations:** Enhance loading indicators with more engaging visuals.
*   **Form Feedback:** Add microinteractions for form focus, input, and button clicks.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure all animations respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` setting.

## 5. Formalized Testing Strategy Implementation

Fully implement the comprehensive testing plan:

*   **Unit Tests:** Expand coverage for utility functions, stores, and core logic.
*   **Component Tests:** Write tests for all major Svelte components.
*   **Integration Tests:** Verify interactions between components and services (e.g., Form -> API Client -> Verdict Display).
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Develop Playwright tests covering critical user journeys (verification flow, game flow, authentication).
*   **Performance Testing:** Integrate Lighthouse audits and measure key performance metrics.
*   **Accessibility Testing:** Use automated tools (Axe) and manual checks for WCAG compliance.
*   **Cross-Browser/Device Testing:** Ensure compatibility across major browsers and device sizes using Playwright.

## 6. Myth History & Bookmarks

Introduce features for tracking user activity:

*   **History Timeline:** Display a chronological list of past verifications.
*   **Bookmark System:** Allow users to save specific verification results.
*   **Persistence:** Store history and bookmarks locally or server-side (if user accounts are utilized).

## 7. Share Image Generation

Implement functionality to create shareable visual summaries:

*   **Generate Image:** Create a visual card summarizing the myth and verdict.
*   **Download Option:** Allow users to download the generated image.
*   **Social Sharing:** Enhance social sharing options using the generated image or a preview link.

## 8. API Request Robustness

Improve reliability of API calls:

*   **Retry Logic:** Implement retry mechanisms for transient API errors (e.g., network issues, temporary server errors).
*   **Exponential Backoff:** Use an exponential backoff strategy for retries to avoid overwhelming the API.

## 9. Game Refinements

Enhance the Myth Busting Game:

*   **More Diverse Statements:** Expand the range of topics and difficulty levels generated by the AI.

*   **Leaderboard:** (Requires backend/database) Implement a global or user-based leaderboard.

*   **Daily Challenges:** Introduce themed daily quizzes.

*   **Achievements/Badges:** Award users for reaching milestones or correct streaks.

## 10. Accessibility Audit and Improvements

Conduct a thorough accessibility audit and address identified issues:

*   **WCAG Compliance:** Aim for full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
*   **Screen Reader Support:** Ensure all dynamic content and interactive elements are properly announced.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Verify all functionality is operable with a keyboard.
*   **Color Contrast:** Re-evaluate and ensure sufficient contrast throughout the UI.

## 11. Potential Paid Features

Introduce premium features for advanced users or enhanced experiences:

*   **Unlimited Deep Research:** Offer unlimited access to the core deep research pillars (Multi-Angle Investigation, Evidence Deconstruction, Dynamic Insight Synthesis) and planned advanced features (Comparative Myth Analysis, Longitudinal Information Trace).
*   **Enhanced Source Analysis:** Provide more in-depth analysis of sources, including automated credibility scores, publication history summaries, or side-by-side source comparisons.
*   **Advanced Game Features:** Offer premium game modes, such as unlimited access to themed learning tracks, daily challenges with larger rewards, or access to a global leaderboard.
*   **Expanded History and Bookmarks:** Provide unlimited storage for past research sessions and the ability to bookmark a large number of myths.
*   **Priority Processing:** Prioritize API requests for paid users to ensure faster response times for complex tasks.

This roadmap serves as a guide for prioritizing and implementing future features and improvements to make the Myth Buster application even more powerful and user-friendly.
