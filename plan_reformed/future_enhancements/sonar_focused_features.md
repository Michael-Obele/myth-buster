## Sonar API-Focused Future Features

These feature ideas are designed to expand the application's use of the Perplexity Sonar API, going beyond the current verification and game statement generation, incorporating further brainstorming.

### I. Deeper Analysis & Contextual Information (Expanding `/app`)

*   **1. Multi-Perspective & Nuance Analysis:**
    *   **Description:** When a user submits a myth, especially a nuanced or controversial one, make multiple, slightly varied queries to the Sonar API to gather different angles or perspectives. For example:
        *   `"What is the scientific consensus on [myth]?"`
        *   `"What are common arguments against [myth]?"`
        *   `"Are there any cultural contexts where [myth] is believed to be true?"`
        *   `"For the myth '[the myth text]', what are the elements of truth, elements of falsehood, and the main points of contention or nuance?"`
    *   **Sonar Usage:** Multiple API calls per user query, focusing on different facets of the myth.
    *   **Impact:** Provides a more comprehensive, balanced, and nuanced understanding.
    *   **Complexity:** Medium to High (requires logic to synthesize multiple API responses).
*   **2. "Follow the Evidence" / "Dig Deeper" Functionality:**
    *   **Description:** After an initial verification, allow users to click on specific parts of the explanation or on a citation to trigger a new Sonar API query for more details on that specific point.
        *   Prompt examples: `"Tell me more about the study mentioned: [specific citation details]"` or `"What is the significance of [key fact mentioned in Sonar's explanation]?"`
    *   **Sonar Usage:** User-initiated follow-up queries based on initial results.
    *   **Impact:** Enables users to explore topics in more depth organically, turning verification into an investigation.
    *   **Complexity:** Medium.
*   **3. Automated Related & Variant Myths Generation:**
    *   **Description:** Instead of just one `relatedMyth`, use the Sonar API to generate a list of 3-5 truly related questions or common follow-up myths. Also, explore common variations of the original myth.
        *   Prompt examples: `"Based on the explanation for '[original myth]', what are 3 related myths or common follow-up questions people might have?"` or `"Are there common variations or different versions of the myth that '[original myth text]'?"`
    *   **Sonar Usage:** Secondary API call(s) after the main verification.
    *   **Impact:** Enhances content discovery, user journey, and understanding of myth evolution.
    *   **Complexity:** Medium.
*   **4. Source Analysis & Summary:**
    *   **Description:** For each citation provided by Sonar, make an additional Sonar query *about that source* to provide users with a brief summary of the source's general bias, reliability, or the author's background, if known.
        *   Prompt example: `"Briefly summarize the typical stance and reliability of [source URL or publication name]."`
    *   **Sonar Usage:** Multiple small API calls for each citation.
    *   **Impact:** Helps users critically evaluate the provided evidence.
    *   **Complexity:** High (could be API-intensive, needs careful rate limit management).
*   **5. Myth Evolution Tracker & Origin Story:**
    *   **Description:** For well-known myths, use Sonar to trace their historical origins and how belief in them has changed over time, including key events or discoveries that impacted perception.
        *   Prompt example: `"Trace the history and evolution of the myth '[myth statement]'. When did it start, how did it become popular, and what is its current status?"`
    *   **Sonar Usage:** Dedicated API call(s) for historical narrative.
    *   **Impact:** Adds significant educational depth and engaging, story-driven content.
    *   **Complexity:** Medium.
*   **6. Dynamic Myth Categorization:**
    *   **Description:** After Sonar verifies a myth, ask Sonar to categorize it (e.g., science, history, health, culture). This can be used for filtering user history or organizing content.
        *   Prompt example: `"What category would '[the myth text]' best fit into (e.g., science, history, health, culture)?"`
    *   **Sonar Usage:** A quick secondary API call for categorization.
    *   **Impact:** Improves content organization and discoverability.
    *   **Complexity:** Low to Medium.

### II. Enhancing Game Content & Dynamics (`/game`)

*   **7. Themed Game Rounds Generated by Sonar:**
    *   **Description:** Allow users to select a theme. Use Sonar API to generate a set of game statements specifically for that theme.
        *   Prompt example: `"Generate 5 game statements (true or false) about 'Ancient Rome myths and facts', suitable for a myth-busting game. Format as JSON..."`
    *   **Sonar Usage:** API calls to generate themed batches of questions.
    *   **Impact:** Increases game variety and replayability.
    *   **Complexity:** Medium.
*   **8. "Explain the Flaw" Game Mode:**
    *   **Description:** The game presents a *false* statement. The user picks from multiple (AI-generated) potential reasons *why* it's false.
        *   Sonar first generates a false myth and its explanation.
        *   A second Sonar call: `"For the false statement '[false myth]', provide its correct explanation and two plausible but incorrect explanations (distractors)."`
    *   **Sonar Usage:** Two API calls per game question in this mode.
    *   **Impact:** Deeper learning and critical thinking within the game.
    *   **Complexity:** High.
*   **9. Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment in Game:**
    *   **Description:** Based on the user's performance, use Sonar to generate progressively harder or easier statements.
        *   Prompt includes difficulty parameter: `"Generate a [easy/medium/hard] myth for a game..."`
    *   **Sonar Usage:** API calls tailored to user performance.
    *   **Impact:** More personalized and engaging game experience.
