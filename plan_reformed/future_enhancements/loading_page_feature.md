# Loading Page Feature Plan

## Objective

Implement a loading page feature to provide visual feedback to users when a page or component takes an extended period to load, improving user experience and preventing perceived unresponsiveness.

## Rationale

When data fetching or complex rendering delays occur, users may perceive the application as frozen or broken. A clear loading indicator or page reassures users that the application is still working and provides an estimate of progress.

## Implementation Details

*   **Global Loading Indicator:** A global loading indicator (e.g., a spinner, progress bar, or skeleton screen) should be displayed when navigating between pages or when initial data fetches are in progress. This can be integrated into the main layout or a SvelteKit hook.
*   **Component-Specific Loading States:** For components that load data asynchronously after the initial page load, localized loading indicators should be used within the component itself.
*   **Threshold for Display:** A minimum display duration for loading indicators should be considered (e.g., only show if loading takes longer than 300ms) to avoid flickering for very fast loads.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure loading indicators are accessible and convey their meaning to users with disabilities (e.g., ARIA live regions).

## Technologies/Libraries

*   **SvelteKit `+page.svelte` and `+layout.svelte`:** Utilize SvelteKit's built-in loading states and lifecycle hooks for page-level loading indicators.
*   **Svelte `{#await}` blocks:** For component-level asynchronous data loading.
*   **UI Components:** Leverage existing UI component libraries (e.g., Shadcn-Svelte) for pre-built loading spinners or progress bars.

## Future Considerations

*   **Optimistic UI:** For certain actions, consider optimistic UI updates where the UI immediately reflects the expected outcome, and then updates if the actual result differs.
*   **Progress Estimation:** For very long operations, consider providing a more detailed progress bar with estimated completion times.
