# Deep Research Metrics & Assessment Framework

This document outlines the metrics and assessment framework for evaluating and demonstrating the depth and quality of research provided by the Myth Buster application.

## 1. Quantitative Research Metrics

These metrics quantify the depth and breadth of research conducted using the Sonar API.

### Source Coverage Metrics

* **Source Count:** Total number of unique sources analyzed in a complete research journey
* **Source Type Distribution:** Breakdown of sources by category (academic, news, government, etc.)
* **Citation Depth:** Average number of supporting citations per research lens
* **Source Recency:** Percentage of sources published within the last 1/2/5 years
* **Domain Diversity:** Number of unique domains referenced across all sources

### Research Depth Metrics

* **Research Layers:** Number of nested research steps conducted (initial verification → lens analysis → source analysis → synthesis)
* **Lens Utilization:** Number and types of research lenses employed in a single investigation
* **Query Complexity:** Average length and sophistication of Sonar API prompts used
* **Research Time Savings:** Estimated time saved compared to manual research (calculated based on complexity)
* **Information Extraction Density:** Volume of unique insights extracted per source

### User Engagement Metrics

* **Research Session Duration:** Time spent in active research beyond initial verification
* **Interaction Depth:** Number of research actions taken per session (lens selections, source analyses, etc.)
* **Customization Rate:** Percentage of research journeys that include user-customized prompts or lenses
* **Research Completion:** Percentage of users who progress from verification to synthesis
* **Return Rate:** Frequency with which users revisit previous research sessions

## 2. Qualitative Research Assessment

These frameworks evaluate the quality and usefulness of the research provided.

### Information Quality Framework

* **Factual Accuracy:** Correctness of information provided across research layers
* **Source Credibility:** Authority and reliability of cited sources
* **Analytical Depth:** Level of critical analysis beyond fact presentation
* **Nuance Recognition:** Ability to capture complexity and conditional aspects
* **Perspective Diversity:** Inclusion of multiple viewpoints and interpretations

### Research Value Framework

* **Novel Insight Generation:** Production of non-obvious connections or conclusions
* **Contextual Enrichment:** Addition of historical, cultural, or disciplinary context
* **Question Evolution:** Identification of deeper or more precise questions beyond the initial query
* **Misconception Clarification:** Effective addressing of common misunderstandings
* **Knowledge Synthesis:** Integration of disparate information into coherent understanding

## 3. Research Journey Analytics

Analysis of how users navigate through the research process.

### Path Analysis

* **Common Research Sequences:** Frequently observed paths through research features
* **Entry Point Diversity:** Distribution of initial research angles selected
* **Pivot Patterns:** Frequency and nature of research direction changes
* **Depth vs. Breadth:** Balance between deep diving into specific angles vs. exploring multiple angles
* **Terminal Points:** Where users typically conclude their research journey

### User-Directed Research Patterns

* **Custom Query Themes:** Common themes in user-created research lenses
* **Refinement Behaviors:** How users modify suggested prompts
* **Cross-Reference Frequency:** How often users compare findings across lenses
* **Follow-up Question Types:** Categories of secondary questions users ask after initial findings
* **Synthesis Triggers:** What volume or type of research typically prompts users to synthesize

## 4. Comparative Research Benchmarks

Frameworks for comparing Myth Buster's research capabilities to alternatives.

### Research Depth Comparison

* **Fact-Checking Standard:** Simple true/false with brief explanation
* **Basic AI Response:** Single-prompt answer with minimal sourcing
* **Intermediate Research:** Multi-source answer with some context
* **Myth Buster Standard:** Multi-angle investigation with source analysis and synthesis
* **Expert Human Research:** Comprehensive literature review with critical analysis

### Time-to-Insight Comparison

* **Search Engine:** Time required to find relevant information through manual search
* **Basic AI:** Time to generate a simple answer with limited sources
* **Myth Buster:** Time to complete a comprehensive research journey
* **Manual Research:** Estimated time for a human to conduct equivalent research

## 5. Implementation for Hackathon Demonstration

### Real-Time Research Dashboard

* **Implementation:** Create a subtle overlay during research that displays:
  * Current research depth (number of layers)
  * Sources analyzed (count and types)
  * Estimated time saved
  * Research journey map (small visualization)

### User Journey Artifacts

* **Research Summary Report:** Generate an exportable document at the conclusion of research showing:
  * Research path taken
  * Total sources analyzed
  * Key insights by research lens
  * Synthesis highlights
  * Metrics on research depth

### Demo-Specific Metrics

* **Pre-calculated Comparisons:** For the demo video, prepare specific metrics for the chosen example:
  * "This investigation analyzed 18 sources across 4 research angles"
  * "Equivalent manual research would require approximately 3.5 hours"
  * "The synthesis identified 3 key themes and 2 significant contradictions"

## 6. Technical Implementation Notes

### Metrics Collection

* Track and store all Sonar API calls associated with a research session
* Parse response metadata to extract source information
* Implement timing functions to measure processing durations
* Develop a complexity scoring algorithm for research paths

### Visualization Strategy

* Use subtle, non-intrusive metrics displays during active research
* Create more detailed visualizations for research summary views
* Implement a simple research journey map showing the path taken
* Consider a "research depth" gauge for quick assessment

### Privacy Considerations

* Make metrics collection transparent to users
* Allow opting out of detailed tracking
* Anonymize all research journey data used for aggregate analysis
* Focus on process metrics rather than content-specific metrics

These metrics and assessment frameworks provide a comprehensive approach to quantifying and demonstrating the deep research capabilities of the Myth Buster application, supporting our positioning for the "Best Deep Research Project" category.
