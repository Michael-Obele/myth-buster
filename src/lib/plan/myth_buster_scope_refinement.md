# Myth Buster Web App - Refined Scope

## Feature Prioritization

### Must Have (Core Functionality)
1. **Myth Verification Interface**
   - Clean, intuitive input field for statement entry
   - Clear verdict display (True/False/Inconclusive)
   - Comprehensive explanation with debunking details
   - Citation links from Sonar API
   - Optimized API integration with proper error handling

2. **Visual Verdict Cues**
   - Distinctive icons for each verdict type (check, X, question mark)
   - Color-coded responses (green, red, purple)
   - Smooth animations for verdict reveal
   - Loading states during API processing

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach ensuring usability on all devices
   - Accessible interface meeting WCAG AA standards
   - Properly scaled elements for different screen sizes

### Should Have (Important Enhancements)
1. **Audio Cues**
   - Simple, non-intrusive sounds for different verdicts
   - Volume control and mute toggle
   - Preloaded audio files to prevent delays

2. **Theme Toggle**
   - Dark/light mode switch with consistent visual language
   - Local storage persistence
   - Proper color contrast in both modes

3. **Basic Error Handling**
   - Friendly error messages for API failures
   - Retry options for failed requests
   - Offline indication when connection is lost

### Nice to Have (If Time Permits)
1. **Confidence Meter**
   - User prediction interface before seeing verdict
   - Comparison between user confidence and actual result
   - Visual feedback on accuracy

2. **Myth-Busting Streaks**
   - Simple counter for consecutive verifications
   - Small visual reward for milestones
   - Local storage for persistence

### Future Expansion (Post-Hackathon)
1. **Myth Origin Stories**
   - Historical context and origins of common myths
   - Rich media integration (images, timelines)
   - Additional API integration for deeper research

2. **Seasonal/Themed Myths**
   - Curated collections based on holidays or events
   - Seasonal visual themes and decorations
   - Community-contributed myths

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Tracking of most common myth categories
   - User behavior analysis for interface optimization
   - Performance metrics for API integration

## Rationale for Scope Refinement

1. **Focus on Core Value Proposition**
   The primary purpose of the app is to verify statements and debunk myths with evidence. By prioritizing the verification interface, visual cues, and responsive design, we ensure the core functionality is polished and reliable.

2. **Technical Feasibility**
   Hackathons have tight timeframes, and Svelte 5 is still new with potential compatibility challenges. Focusing on fewer, well-implemented features minimizes technical risk and ensures a stable submission.

3. **User Experience Quality**
   A smaller feature set allows more attention to detail on animations, transitions, and micro-interactions that create a delightful user experience. This aligns perfectly with the "Most Fun / Creative Project" category.

4. **Demo Impact**
   For judging purposes, a focused app with polished core features will create a stronger impression than a broader but less refined implementation. The 3-minute demo can showcase the verification flow in depth rather than rushing through multiple features.

5. **Resource Allocation**
   The refined scope allows more time for:
   - Testing across devices and browsers
   - Optimizing API integration
   - Creating engaging animations
   - Polishing the visual design
   - Preparing a compelling demo

By adopting this prioritized approach, the Myth Buster app can deliver a high-quality, focused experience that stands out in the hackathon while maintaining a realistic development timeline.
