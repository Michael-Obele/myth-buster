# Myth Buster Feature Prioritization Matrix

| Feature | Priority | Complexity | Impact | Implementation Time | Decision |
|---------|----------|------------|--------|---------------------|----------|
| **Verification Interface** | High | Medium | High | 1 day | **Must Have** |
| **Visual Cues** | High | Low | High | 0.5 day | **Must Have** |
| **Sonar API Integration** | High | Medium | High | 1 day | **Must Have** |
| **Responsive Design** | High | Medium | High | 0.5 day | **Must Have** |
| **Audio Cues** | Medium | Low | Medium | 0.5 day | **Should Have** |
| **Theme Toggle** | Medium | Low | Medium | 0.5 day | **Should Have** |
| **Error Handling** | High | Medium | High | 0.5 day | **Should Have** |
| **Confidence Meter** | Medium | Medium | Medium | 1 day | **Nice to Have** |
| **Myth-Busting Streaks** | Low | Low | Medium | 0.5 day | **Nice to Have** |
| **Myth Origin Stories** | Low | High | Medium | 2 days | **Future** |

## Development Time Budget (Hackathon Timeline)

Assuming a 48-hour hackathon:

- **Must Have Features**: ~3 days (implementation effort)
- **Should Have Features**: ~1.5 days
- **Nice to Have Features**: ~1.5 days
- **Testing & Debugging**: 1 day
- **Documentation & Demo Prep**: 0.5 day

With timeline compression and parallel work, the Must Have and Should Have features can realistically be completed within the hackathon timeframe, with potential for one Nice to Have feature if development proceeds smoothly.

## Feature Dependencies

```
