# Phased Development Approach for Myth Buster App

This document outlines a structured, phased approach to developing the Myth Buster app for the hackathon. By organizing development into distinct phases with clear dependencies and checkpoints, we ensure a methodical progression that prioritizes core functionality while allowing for iterative enhancement.

## Development Philosophy

Our development approach follows these key principles:

1. **Working Product First**: Always maintain a working version of the application, with each phase building on a stable foundation
2. **Critical Path Focus**: Prioritize features essential to the core verification functionality
3. **Incremental Testing**: Implement test checkpoints between phases to catch issues early
4. **Clear Dependencies**: Explicitly identify dependencies between components and features
5. **Time-Boxed Iterations**: Assign realistic time frames to each phase with built-in buffer time
6. **Measurable Progress**: Define clear completion criteria for each phase

## Overview of Development Phases

The development process is divided into four main phases:

1. **Foundation**: Project setup, API integration, and basic UI scaffolding
2. **Core Features**: Verification flow, verdict display, and citation rendering
3. **Enhancement**: Visual/audio cues, theme toggle, and user experience improvements
4. **Polish**: Animations, performance optimization, and final refinements

- **Error Handling Test**: Validate error states trigger appropriately
- **Responsive Design Check**: Test layout on multiple screen sizes

### After Core Features Phase

- **End-to-End Flow Test**: Verify complete verification process works
- **Edge Case Testing**: Test with various input types and API responses
- **State Management Test**: Ensure application state updates correctly
- **Citation Rendering Test**: Validate citations display correctly from API data

### After Enhancement Phase

- **Feature Toggle Test**: Verify all toggleable features work correctly
- **Theme Switch Test**: Ensure theme switching works without visual issues
- **Audio Playback Test**: Validate sound effects play correctly
- **Onboarding Flow Test**: Test complete user onboarding experience

### After Polish Phase

- **Accessibility Audit**: Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Animation Smoothness Check**: Verify animations run at 60fps
- **Cross-Browser Test**: Validate functionality across Chrome, Firefox, Safari

## Challenges and Contingency Plans

To mitigate potential development challenges:

1. **API Rate Limiting**
   - *Challenge*: Sonar API may have rate limits that affect development and testing
   - *Contingency*: Enhance mock API responses and caching for development

2. **Svelte 5 Compatibility Issues**
   - *Challenge*: Svelte 5 is new and may have compatibility issues with libraries
   - *Contingency*: Prepare fallback approaches using standard Svelte 4 patterns if needed

3. **Time Constraints**
   - *Challenge*: Some features may take longer than estimated
   - *Contingency*: Prioritize "Must Have" features from Phase 1-2 and maintain a working app

4. **Browser Compatibility**
   - *Challenge*: Features may work differently across browsers
   - *Contingency*: Focus on Chrome compatibility first, then expand to other browsers

## Development Environment Setup

To ensure consistent development:

```bash
# Initial setup
npm create svelte@latest myth-buster
cd myth-buster

# Install dependencies
npm install
npm install shadcn-svelte@latest lucide-svelte

# Initialize shadcn-svelte
npx shadcn-svelte@latest init

# Setup for development
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Branching Strategy

For organized development:

- `main` - Stable, working version
- `foundation` - Phase 1 development
- `core-features` - Phase 2 development
- `enhancement` - Phase 3 development
- `polish` - Phase 4 development
- `feature/*` - Individual feature development

## Conclusion

This phased development approach provides a clear roadmap for implementing the Myth Buster app within the hackathon timeframe. By breaking the work into distinct phases with explicit dependencies and testing checkpoints, we ensure a methodical progression that prioritizes core functionality while allowing for iterative enhancement.

The schedule allocates sufficient time for each phase while providing buffer for unexpected challenges. By following this approach, we can deliver a polished, functional application that meets all requirements while maintaining code quality and user experience.
