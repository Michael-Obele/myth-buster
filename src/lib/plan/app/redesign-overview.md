# App Route Redesign Plan

## Current Analysis

The current app route implements a myth-busting tool with the following features:
- Myth input and submission form
- Loading states and analysis progress
- Results display with verdict (True/False/Inconclusive)
- Detailed explanation with citation linking
- Citation viewing through hover cards
- Accordion for displaying all citations
- Origin of myth information (when available)
- Cache indicator and cache clearing functionality
- Reset functionality to verify another myth

While functional, the current design is relatively simple and could benefit from enhanced visual appeal, animations, and improved user experience.

## Redesign Goals

1. **Enhanced Visual Design**: Create a more visually appealing interface while maintaining functionality
2. **Improved User Experience**: Streamline the user journey and add micro-interactions
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure better responsiveness and usability on mobile devices
4. **Performance Improvements**: Optimize rendering and state management with Svelte 5
5. **Accessibility Enhancements**: Improve accessibility for all users
6. **New Features**: Add valuable features that enhance the myth-busting experience

## Technology Stack

- **Svelte 5**: Utilize the latest Svelte features including `$state` and `$derived`, avoiding `$effect` when possible
- **ShadCN-Svelte-Next**: Leverage advanced UI components for consistent design
- **Svelte-Magic-UI**: Incorporate animated components for visual flair
- **Svelte-Motion**: Use for smooth transitions and animations
- **Lucide-Svelte**: For iconography throughout the interface

## Implementation Approach

The redesign will be implemented in phases:
1. Core UI component upgrades
2. Layout and structure improvements
3. Animation and interaction enhancements
4. New feature additions
5. Testing and refinement

Each section of this plan provides detailed specifications for the different aspects of the redesign.
